# LabelMyTextWidget

LabelMyTextWidget is an iPythonWidget to quickly label text data.

This goal of this project is to speed up and simplify the process of manual labeling.

The widget provides a minimalist interface to review each row of a pandas dataframe and apply a label to it.

## How to use the widget

A Jupyter notebook is at the root of the repository, and it contains an example.

## How to install it

For the time being, you have to download the folder LabelMyTextWidget and put it in your project repository.
Better installation options and packaging will come soon.

Besides that, the following should be installed:

`
pip install ipywidgets
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
